# Go API Server for api

This is the IPFS Pinning Service API. It attempts to be an implementation-agnostic API designed to be implemented by Pinning Service Providers.  This specification does **NOT** define the IPFS pinning API.  GitHub discussion around this API can be found in [ipfs/notes](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/378).   **Critical Notice**  To allow backend systems behind the API to associate pins with a particular user, the API requires that a JSON Web Token is passed with requests that contains a `sub` claim (as specified by [OpenIDConnect Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)) that represents the user's identity within the backend system, so as to associate the user with their pins. This allows the backend system to use the identity as a form of reference counting on pins, therefore only removing pins once no other users have it pinned.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]

By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t api .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it api 
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
